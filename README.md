## Description
Exquisite corpse—*cadavre exquis* if you're nasty—is a parlor game developed by French surrealists in the early 20th century. The idea is that a group of people play together to build a collage of images or, as is the case here, words: a poem with many poets. Each person takes turns writing a line, building on the lines that came before. Welcome to the world's biggest, never-ending game of exquisite corpse.

## User Story
```
AS A [possibly frustrated] writer, I WANT TO work on poems with other writers SO THAT I can write compelling poetry and have fun doing it.
This is a collaborative writing app inspired by the surrealist parlor game, in which a group of people take turns crafing a poem. Users will sign in and either create a new poem or add to an existing one. 
```
